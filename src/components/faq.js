                    Throughout our extensive testing with users and doctors, the medical profile is one of the biggest value add for you. 
                    It is extremely important that this information is available for the doctor's view because it contextualizes 
                    the question and may provide helpful clues to answering your questions.

                    Having this completed also prevents back and forths that most doctors would want to know 
                    in most scenarios and helps you establish a profile for the 2nd post and any following that.

                    Currently we only support one user profile which establishes your personal medical profile that doctors 
                    refer to when addressing your questions. It is extremely important that this information is available 
                    for the doctor's view because it contextualizes the question and may provide helpful clues to answering

                    However, if you wish to use this on behalf of another member, it is best to help them make an account 
                    and create a post. Another way is to create a post and clearly say it is for another person and include 
                    as much information as possible in the post about their question and state of health.
